The optimization of wave function parameters is done by multiplying the Jastrow factors. The inprovements can be made by adding pseudo-potential calculations also into VMC.
-e stands for writing a series of xommands for the shell to execute them.
-q stands for putting
vmc and scf are different. scf find the optimal coefficients of the basis functions which can be viewed as a motion of the syste in the coefficient space towards the energy minimum
while vmc tries to optimize the variational parameter by minimizing the expecation value of the energy.
